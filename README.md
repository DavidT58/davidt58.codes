# My experimental website

This main purpose of this website is to test and deploy various web technologies - basically a playground.

## General information

This [website](davidt58.codes) is currently deployed on digital ocean, on a single Ubuntu 18 droplet.

Currently, I am testing an URL shortener implemented in NodeJS + Express, along with a MongoDB database for storing shortened URL's.


## Usage

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and run the website locally with the following commands:

```bash
cd davidt58.codes/server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Requirements:
NodeJS v12

MongoDB v3.6.3
